This is a weather application built using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. It utilizes the Open Weather API to retrieve real-time weather data for any location. Axios simplifies making HTTP requests to the API, and Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach for creating responsive and stylish UI components.
